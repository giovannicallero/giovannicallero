# NFL Team Performance Analysis (Python)

This project analyzes game results from the 2024–2025 NFL season to identify trends in scoring, wins, and opponent performance. 

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Data Used
- Real NFL game results (sampled and cleaned)
- File: `nfl_games_sample.csv`

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned raw NFL game data using Pandas
- Calculated team win totals, average points scored, and point differentials
- Identified trends in home vs. away performance
- Created visual summaries of scoring trends and point distributions

## Key Insights
- Teams with the highest point differential consistently ranked at the top of league standings.
- Several teams performed significantly better at home than away.
- High-scoring teams were not always the teams with the best win-loss record.

## Files in This Project
